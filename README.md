# SuperWoW
SuperWoW is a launcher/mod made for the 1.12.1 version of World of Warcraft with the purpose of fixing client bugs and expanding the lua-based API used by user interface addons.

# FAQ
- Q: How does this mod work?
  
A: SuperWoW is a dll injection. Executing the launcher launches the base game (WoW.exe file in the same directory) and injects a dll (dynamic link library). This gives the mod access to the game's allocated memory within your RAM. The mod edits the process' memory to change certain variables and instructions, and to make use of code caves and function detouring. The program does not alter any computer files, of the game or otherwise, not permanently nor temporarily. launching the client from the original .exe file will launch the exact same game you had on your game directory before you used the mod.


- Q: Are dll injections safe?
  
A: Dlls have legitimate use cases in Software extensibility, such as the benchmarking & screen capture tool Fraps. However, it can also be used for malicious purposes to bypass security measures and steal sensitive information. It's essential to understand the potential risks, vulnerabilities, and implications associated with closed source DLL injection activities.


- Q: Why is this program closed source?
  
A: Making the mod open source [by definition](https://opensource.org/osd) licenses it for commercial use without requiring permission, and permits the creation of derived works that can very easily bypass the countermeasures placed within this mod to stop it being used for automation, cheating, or any other methods to gain a **direct** gameplay advantage.


- Q: Does this mod give any gameplay advantage?
  
A: It does that indirectly by improving the user interface, making it more direct and require less inter-player communication through hidden messages that drain both player and server resource. The functionalities it adds are recreations of Classic Client functionalities familiar to people who play on 1.12.1 servers using Hermes Proxy.


- Q: Is the mod stable and bug free?

A: There is no guarantee of stability. It is greatly appreciated to report all bugs or crashes in this repository's bugtracker, copying or screenshotting the crash log and detailing reproduction steps.


- Q: Will this mod work with X mod / addon / server

A: There is no guarantee that the mod is compatible with any specific mod, addon, or server's custom client. [It is greatly appreciated to document everything that is compatible or not compatible with the mod in the bugtracker](https://github.com/balakethelock/SuperWoW/wiki/Compability-with-other-mods).


- Q: Is this mod allowed by X server? Will it get cought by anti-cheat?
  
A: The mod makes no attempt at hiding itself from Warden, any server can easily ban for it if they choose to do so. Use at your own discretion.
